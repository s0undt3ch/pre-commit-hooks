"""Tests for the ``pin-github-actions`` pre-commit hook.

The hook locks `uses:` refs to SHAs and verifies already-pinned ones against
their tag comment in a single default pass. It is a standalone script under
``.pre-commit-hooks/`` (not an importable package), loaded via
``importlib.util.spec_from_file_location``. No test touches the network: the
per-line verify tests inject a fake resolver into ``verify_action_line``, and
the ``process_file`` / cache tests stub the ``gh`` subprocess via ``gh_stub``.
